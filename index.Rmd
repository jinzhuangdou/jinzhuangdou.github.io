title: "About me"
---

I am a computational biologist at [MD Anderson Cancer Center](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/ken-chen-laboratory.html). Trained as a mathematician, I obtained a PhD in Genetics from [Ocean University of China](https://cmls.ouc.edu.cn/2023/0910/c13673a441182/page.html). From June 2015- June 2018, I was a postdoc at the [Genome Institute of Singapore](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis) in Singapore with research focusing on human population genetics. From June 2020, as an associated data scientist, I worked at MD Anderson Cancer Center with research focusing on single cell genomics.

In my research, I aim to apply statistical reasoning in combination with modern machine learning approaches to gain insights into complex diseases (including cancer). For this I develop statistical methods and computational tools to analyse and integrate 'omics data and apply them in a variety of fields including personalized medicine, cancer biology, and single cell biology.
